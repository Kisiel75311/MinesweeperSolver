## üìç Overview

The project includes code for a Minesweeper game and an agent that can play the game using a Q-table or a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model. The agent learns from its interactions with the game environment and makes decisions based on exploration and exploitation strategies. The code also provides visualization of the game's performance. The project can be used to study and experiment with reinforcement learning algorithms and their application to Minesweeper.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The MinesweeperSolver codebase follows a modular architecture that separates the different components of the system. The main.py file serves as the entry point for the Minesweeper game, where an instance of the MinesweeperSolver class is created. It utilizes the DQNAgent class from DQNAgent.py to train and play the game using a Deep Q-Network. The MinesweeperAgent class from MinesweeperAgent.py implements an alternative approach for playing the game using a Q-table. The Minesweeper class from Minesweeper.py is responsible for initializing and managing the game board, generating mines, handling player moves, and game state. Overall, the codebase exhibits a clear separation of concerns, allowing for extensibility and maintainability.    |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The documentation for the MinesweeperSolver codebase is comprehensive and well-structured. Each file in the repository has a brief summary of its functionality and purpose. However, the documentation could benefit from additional explanations of key concepts and design decisions. Code comments are present throughout the codebase, providing clarity on the purpose and functionality of specific sections of code. Overall, the documentation is helpful for understanding the codebase, but could be enhanced to provide more insights and explanations.   |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The MinesweeperSolver codebase relies on several external libraries and systems. It uses Keras and TensorFlow for building and training the Deep Q-Network agent. These libraries provide essential functionality for implementing the neural network model and reinforcement learning algorithms. Additionally, the codebase relies on standard Python libraries such as NumPy and random for various utility functions and mathematical operations. These dependencies are well-documented and widely used, ensuring stability and compatibility.   |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The codebase demonstrates good modularity, with clearly defined and encapsulated components. Each file represents a distinct functionality or module. The MinesweeperSolver class in main.py acts as the main orchestrator, utilizing the DQNAgent and Minesweeper classes to train and play Minesweeper. The DQNAgent class in DQNAgent.py encapsulates the functionality for building and training the Deep Q-Network model. The MinesweeperAgent class in MinesweeperAgent.py provides an alternative implementation using a Q-table. The Minesweeper class in Minesweeper.py handles the game logic and state management. The modular organization of the codebase allows for easy extensibility and maintainability.   |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | The codebase does not contain explicit testing strategies or tools. However, the functionality of key components such as the Minesweeper class and the DQNAgent class could benefit from unit tests to ensure their correctness and robustness. Implementing test cases using a testing framework like unittest
